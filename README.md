# gvrDemo 0.1.0 alpha
Google Daydream demo app using Unity 5.4

This is a simple Daydream app created to showcase the technical skills necessary for producing an interactive VR world.

The [latest](https://github.com/jdknox/vrDemo/blob/develop/build/jeff_knox_vr_demo.apk) Android version can be found in the [build](https://github.com/jdknox/vrDemo/tree/develop/build) folder.


# Running the demo
A second Android phone to act as the controller emulator is required as described [here](https://developers.google.com/vr/concepts/controller-emulator).
The in-game controls are as follows:
* Touchpad area (large circle): character movement
* Touchpad double tap (click emulation): interact
* App button: interact

# Future improvements
Optimization is always ongoing, targeting 60 FPS.  More interactions are in the works, as well as general polishing and cleanup.
